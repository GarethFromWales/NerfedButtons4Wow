# NerfedButtons - Vanilla WoW 1.12 Add-On 

NerfedButtons (NB) lets you define prioritised and conditional ability/item/macro lists for your actionbar buttons. NerfedButtons will automatically ensure that the highest priority ability/item/macro that passes its conditions is bound to the actionbar button slot at any time.

* Too many hotbuttons aggravating your RSI?
* Want to stimulate your brain as well as your reflexes?
* Are you a casual player who wants a chance against those 12 fingered mutants who fluidly play whack-a-mole with 48 buttons 24 hours a day?

if any of the above apply, NerfedButtons may be what you are looking for!

Disclaimer: Understanding NerfedButtons requires a modicum of effort and the exercise of a few brain cells, you have been warned...
